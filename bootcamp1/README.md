## Bootcamp 1: Linux, Python and robotics

As indicated by the title, this bootcamp aims to introduce students to several essentail tools: Ubuntu Linux, Python programming and the development of (autonomous) robotic systems. 
The bootcamp include two parts. First, an online preparation component, which is completed independently by the student. Second, an instructor-led session which will be
held virtually (during MT term 2020 at least). 


### Online preparation (~ 0.5-2 hours)

Given that everyone's backgrounds may differ, this section could be skipped by some, completed in 30 minutes by others or may take a couple of hours. 
Go through it as slowly as you need! **No need to install any special software on your computer.** The recommended resourses are:
* [Python mini-course with Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/python). We recommended you finish sections 1-5. 
Side bonus: you will be awared a certificate if finish all sections.
* [Linux operating system tutorial with virtual command line](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview). We recommend you go through section 1, 3 and 4 at least. Ideally, you already have a computer with the Linux operating system installed. If not, you can use this online simulator: [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/projects/0bf48ed3-5f52-4c43-a332-14b9b4fa168f/files/Welcome%20to%20CoCalc.term?session=default). Some commands may work differently or not at all because it's not a real computer but following the tutorial and playing around with it will give you an idea of how to use command line.

### Instructor-led Session November 7 2020 at 1-3PM (~ 2 hours + Q&A) 

#### Linux Introduction and Overview (30 minutes)
This session will cover the basics of Linux and show some common command line tools.

#### Python Basics and Examples (1 hour)
This session discuss common Python libraries (like numpy and matplotlib). This will be used in an example where a dynamical system is simulated and a PID controller is implemented. The Google Colab notebook for this session will be shared on Slack.

#### Into to Robotics (30 minutes)
This session will cover (on a high-level) the essential componnents needed to build an autonomous robot.
